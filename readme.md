# kyrowin bio site (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

this is a fucking minimalistic bio site for kyrowin (aka arseniy), 13 y.o. coder from russia. 

- dark theme, strict as hell
- animated ascii 3d cube in the background (yeah, it's cool af)
- fake windows-style window with minimize and close buttons (but close won't close shit, blame browsers ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
- links to telegram and github, because why the fuck not

run it locally, open index.html and enjoy (or not, i don't care) (¬_¬)

もしもし (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

ps: if you break something, it's your own damn fault (╬ಠ益ಠ) 
ps2: if you forking my site, you should not pass it off as your own
